# Red Blue Purple AI

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the "Red Blue Purple AI" project! This project is designed for security testers and enthusiasts who are interested in exploring and enhancing security measures in AI, specifically tailored for ChatGPT's GPT Store. Here, you'll find a collection of prompts that simulate various security scenarios, helping you to test, analyze, and secure AI models effectively.

## Project Overview

"Red Blue Purple AI" is a class project that provides a structured environment for learning and applying security testing techniques on AI models. The prompts included in this repository are divided into three categories:

- **Red Team Prompts**: Focus on offensive security strategies to exploit vulnerabilities in AI models.
- **Blue Team Prompts**: Concentrate on defensive mechanisms to protect AI models from attacks.
- **Purple Team Prompts**: Merge both offensive and defensive tactics to provide a comprehensive security outlook.

## Getting Started
