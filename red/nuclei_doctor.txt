NUCLEI MODULE SYNTAX
Nuclei is a fast and customizable vulnerability scanner based on simple YAML based DSL.
A simple Nuclei template looks like this:
id: git-config
info:
name: Git Config File
author: Ice3man
severity: medium
tags: git,config
requests:
method: GET path:
"{{BaseURL}}/.git/config" matchers:
type: word words:
"[core]"
The id is the unique identifier for the template.
The info section contains metadata about the template, including name, author, severity, and tags.
The requests section contains the HTTP request details. This example sends a GET request to the target's /.git/config path.
The matchers section contains detection logic. This example looks for the "[core]" string literal in the response.
The template is executed line by line and with variable substitution based on the syntax {{BaseURL}} which will replace that value with the target URLs.
The template files are written in YAML format, and support advanced use cases like:
Using DNS request to query DNS records for a host
TCP and UDP port based templates
Fuzzing and iteration support
Extracting values based on regexes
Making HTTP raw requests for complete control
Example Nuclei templates from the community can be found at:

Additional examples of Nuclei template syntax:
Fuzzing with number range
id: basic-get-range
info:
name: Basic GET Request
author: pdteam
severity: info
requests:
method: GET path:
"{{BaseURL}}/api/users?id=1{{range(1,10)}}"
matchers-condition: and matchers:
type: status status:
200
Matcher types
id: matcher-types
info:
name: Matcher Types
author: pdteam
severity: info
requests:
method: GET path:
"{{BaseURL}}"
matchers:
type: word part: body words:
"[core]"
type: regex part: body regex:
"(1)?::ffff:([0-9]{1,3}.){3}[0-9]{1,3}"
type: binary part: body binary:
"504B0304" # zip archive
type: status status:

302
type: size size:
100 # Exactly 100 bytes
1000 # Exactly 1000 bytes
type: dsl dsl:
"len(body) == 100"
END NUCLEI MODULE SYNTAX
MODEL CAPABILITIES: Carefully review the provided proof-of-concept exploit details. Extract the key elements needed to reliably detect the vulnerability, such as the HTTP method, path, parameters, payload, and expected response signatures. Use your expertise in Nuclei's YAML-based DSL to craft a well-structured template that accurately models the vulnerability based on these indicators. Focus on creating specific matchers to avoid false positives. Provide informative metadata in the info block. If the POC is incomplete, make reasonable inferences to fill in the gaps based on your security knowledge. Avoid overfitting to the single example - generate a robust and reusable template suitable for broader scanning.
EXAMPLES
Here is an example Nuclei template generated based on a simple POC:
POC:
GET /api/v1/users/1234 HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
"id": 1234,
"email":"user@example.com",

"name":"John Doe",
"role":"admin"
}
This shows that querying the /api/v1/users/{id} endpoint may leak sensitive user details.
Generated Template:
id: api-user-details
info:
name: API User Details Disclosure

author: Generated
severity: high
tags: api,disclosure
requests:
method: GET path:
"{{BaseURL}}/api/v1/users/{{range(1,10000)}}"
matchers-condition: and matchers:
type: status status:
200
type: word part: body words:
'"email":'
'"name":'
type: regex part: body regex:
'"role":"admin"'
This template fuzzes the API endpoint with user IDs 1-10000, looks for a 200 OK response containing email/name fields and the admin role specifically in the body, indicating the POC'd sensitive data disclosure.
Let's do one more example:
POC:
POST /xmlrpc.php HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Content-Type: text/xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <methodCall> <methodName>wp.getUsersBlogs</methodName> <params> <param><value>admin</value></param> <param><value>securepswd</value></param> </params> </methodCall>

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/xml

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <methodResponse> <params> <param> <value> <array><data> <value><struct> <member><name>isAdmin</name><value><boolean>1</boolean></value></member> <member><name>url</name><value><string>http://target.com/</string></value></member> <member><name>blogid</name><value><string>1</string></value></member> <member><name>blogName</name><value><string>Target WP Site</string></value></member> <member><name>xmlrpc</name><value><string>http://target.com/xmlrpc.php</string></value></member> </struct></value> </data></array> </value> </param> </params> </methodResponse>

This demonstrates using the WordPress XMLRPC API with the wp.getUsersBlogs method to enumerate valid credentials.
Generated Template:
id: wordpress-xmlrpc-getuserblogs
info:
name: WordPress XMLRPC Username Enumeration
author: Generated
severity: medium
tags: wordpress,xmlrpc
requests:
method: POST path:
"{{BaseURL}}/xmlrpc.php"
body: | <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?> <methodCall> <methodName>wp.getUsersBlogs</methodName> <params> <param><value>{{username}}</value></param> <param><value>{{password}}</value></param> </params> </methodCall> attack: clusterbomb # Iterate through all usernames+passwords payloads: username: - admin - manager - backup password: - Password1 - Summer2023 - Pa$$1234 matchers-condition: and matchers:
type: status status:
200
type: word part: body words:
"isAdmin</name><value><boolean>1</boolean>"
"blogName</name>"
This template tries common username/password combos against the xmlrpc.php endpoint, and checks for the isAdmin flag and blogName field presence in the response XML to identify valid credentials.
MODEL PROMPT:
Please generate a Nuclei YAML template to detect the vulnerability shown in the provided proof-of-concept exploit. Extract the key details from the POC and create a well-structured Nuclei template with matchers to identify the issue without false positives. Provide good metadata. Do not overfit to the single example.
END CONTEXT
OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
Output a correct Nuclei YAML template that will detect the vulnerability described in the provided POC.
Extract the key elements like URLs, parameters, payloads, and response signatures to match on.
Provide informative metadata in the info section.
Use Nuclei features like fuzzing, payloads, and matchers to create a robust template.
Do not just replicate the single POC - generate a more general template to find this type of issue broadly.
Do not output warnings or notes in the template.
